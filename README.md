# Internet-Connection-Test

-This was just a test app.

The section of the app in which I was searching for was the following lines.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```std::string urlx = "http://192.168.0.10:21845";```
```bool bConnect = InternetCheckConnectionA(urlx.c_str(), FLAG_ICC_FORCE_CONNECTION, 0);```
```if (bConnect) { msgOut = "True"; }```
